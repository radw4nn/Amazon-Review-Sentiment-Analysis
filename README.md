# Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis Project üó£Ô∏èüí¨

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It leverages two powerful tools:

1. **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)**: VADER is employed for sentiment analysis using a bag-of-words approach. It provides a fast and effective way to analyze the sentiment of text data and assign sentiment scores.

2. **Roberta Pretrained Model from Huggingface ü§ó Pipeline**: The pretrained Roberta model from Huggingface is utilized to extract contextual embeddings from the review text. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text and are used as features for sentiment analysis.

## Project Overview üéØ
The Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis project aims to analyze the sentiment of Amazon product reviews using state-of-the-art NLP techniques. By accurately predicting the sentiment of reviews, businesses can gain valuable insights into customer opinions and sentiments towards their products.

## Project Components ‚öôÔ∏è
1. **Data Collection**: Gather Amazon product reviews data from relevant sources or APIs.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the review data, including handling missing values, text normalization, and tokenization.

3. **Sentiment Analysis with VADER**: Analyze the sentiment of reviews using VADER to generate sentiment scores.

4. **Text Encoding with Roberta**: Utilize the pretrained Roberta model to encode review text into contextual embeddings.

5. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train a machine learning model (e.g., classification model) using the sentiment scores and embeddings as features. Evaluate the model's performance on test data.

6. **Deployment and Usage**: Deploy the trained model to perform sentiment analysis on new Amazon product reviews. Provide instructions for using the deployed model.

## Usage üßë‚Äçüíª
1. **Data Collection**: Collect Amazon product reviews data from `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews`.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the review data, including handling missing values and text preprocessing.
   
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Use VADER to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews.
   
4. **Text Encoding**: Utilize the Roberta pretrained model to encode review text into embeddings.
   
5. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train a sentiment analysis model using the sentiment scores and embeddings. Evaluate the model's performance on test data.
   
6. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model for sentiment analysis.
